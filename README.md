# Swidel
An online store designed for selling, purchase and delivery of provisionary,stationary and utility goods and service. This is a side project to expand on what i learned and never practiced so i dont forget what i've learnt cos its advised that junior devs should try to build projects on their own. have been having difficulties in implementing stuff buh as i build, i try stuff out to get things done no matter how messy i get. i learnt it's good to always be the cow so im goona be that cow(o_o).
